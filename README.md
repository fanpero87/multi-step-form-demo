# Multi Step Form Demo

This is a simple app that uses the `session` to pass data over from one step of the form to the next.
I took the code from this [link](https://www.itsolutionstuff.com/post/laravel-multi-step-form-example-tutorialexample.html)

For this demo, im using the following on my `.env` file

```
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=10
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
SESSION_PATH=/
SESSION_DOMAIN=null
```

Im also using the CDN of tailwind to simplify things.
